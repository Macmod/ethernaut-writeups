# Hello Ethernaut

> This level walks you through the very basics of how to play the game.

The goal here is to simply follow the instructions, setting up MetaMask to use the Ropsten network and using the console to interact with the levels' contracts on the blockchain. Remember to store your seed phrase somewhere safe in case you need to recover your wallet later. Also remember to get some test ether from the Ropsten faucet, since you will need it for game transactions later on.
